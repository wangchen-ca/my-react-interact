# My sample React application - my-react-interact

- Technical points: to reflects User interact/click/input, in React, mostly equals to updating state data. React will update the web page automatically for you. We don't need to write code to display a popup, delete a row from a table, or hide a div, we only change the settings or flags in state. [Reread the chapter](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)

The app show 2 tables, one lists available candidates, the other displays selected ones. Users can select/remove candidates.

The app can be extended to add business rules into state operations, reference the the welcome section if interested.
